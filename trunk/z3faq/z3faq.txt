How to write a big question, which is very long and that cannot read in one breath, also it spans more than one line?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Just like this, but we can make questions as much short as we can, without
sacrificing its meaning. Another option is to make the question title 
a summary of the real question, with the full question in the section body.


Is Zope 3 stable enough to be used in production enviroment?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Zope 3 is used in several larger production sites already.  Public
applications include `Launchpad`_, `SchoolTool`_, `Tiks`_  and
`SIP`_.  But there are several custom solutions written too.  But the
development of Zope 3 will probably never be done, it will continue
untill our all needs meets :)

How to validate two or more fields simultaneously?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use `invariants` to control more fields. 

Look at zope.interface/README.txt for details.

Let's consider this more specific question asked to list:

  How do I implement a validation rule that says either email or phone
  have to exist, but not necissarily both.

  Using the buddy demo as an example, with the following interface::

    class IBuddy(zope.interface.Interface):
        """Provides access to basic buddy information"""

        fullname = TextLine(title=_("Name"))
        email = TextLine(title=_("Email Address"))
        phone = TextLine(title=_("Phone Contact"))

First we have to make a callable object, either a simple function or
callable instance of a class::

  def contacts_invariant(obj):
      if not (obj.email or obj.phone):
          raise Exception("At least one contact info is rquired")

Now use `validateInvariants` method of the interface to validate::

  buddy = Buddy()
  buddy.email = u"user.id@some.address.com"
  IRange.validateInvariants(buddy)

Testing
-------


How to run a particular test from a package?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Go to your $ZOPE3INSTANCE/lib, then::

  $ cd $HOME/myzope/lib
  $ ../bin/test.py -vpu --dir package/tests test_this_module

Here I assumed $HOME/myzope is your Zope3 instance directory.
Replace 'package' with your package name.

How to record a session?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To record a session::

  $ mkdir record
  $ tcpwatch.py -L8081:8080 -r record


Should I use __docformat___ = 'restructredtext' in Zope3?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes, if you are using ReStructredText in docstrings, the default
is still structured text.
