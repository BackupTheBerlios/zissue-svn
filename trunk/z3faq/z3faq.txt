How to write a big question, which is very long and that cannot read in one breath, also it spans more than one line?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Just like this, but we can make questions as much short as we can, without
sacrificing its meaning. Another option is to make the question title 
a summary of the real question, with the full question in the section body.


Is Zope 3 stable enough to be used in production enviroment?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Zope 3 is used in several larger production sites already.  Public
applications include `Launchpad`_, `SchoolTool`_ and `Tiks`_. But
there are several custom solutions written too.  But the development
of Zope 3 will probably never be done, it will continue untill our all
needs meets :)

How to run a particular test from a package?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Go to your $ZOPE3INSTANCE/lib, then::

  $ cd $HOME/myzope/lib
  $ ../bin/test.py -vpu --dir package/tests test_this_module

Here I assumed $HOME/myzope is your Zope3 instance directory.
Replace 'package' with your package name.

How to record a session?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To record a session::

  $ mkdir record
  $ tcpwatch.py -L8081:8080 -r record


Should I use __docformat___ = 'restructredtext' in Zope3?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes, if you are using ReStructredText in docstrings, the default
is still structured text.
