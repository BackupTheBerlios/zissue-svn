*Important Note*: I assume you are using Debian 3.1 (Sarge) or similar systems.


Why 30?
-------

Sorry! Zope3 cannot be introduced in 10 minutes.


And why should I ...?
---------------------

If you are looking for a Pythonic framework for web application development,
just continue reading.  And I am *not* going to make a new definition for 
*What is Pythonic?* :) .  Here I will try to answer your "why?" questions.


Keywords
--------

Python, Zope, Interface, Component, ZCML, ZMI, Adapter, View,
Event, Service, Utility, Principal.


So let's start...
-----------------

Zope3 is the third generation of Zope, a framework for web applications.
You can download Zope 3.1 from http://www.zope.org/Products/Zope3 .
To install untar Zope3 source package, then as root::

  # cd Zope-3.1.0
  # ./configure;make;make install

After installation you have to make an instance (don't worry! just do it).  To do so::

  $ cd /usr/local/Zope-3.1.0/bin
  $ ./mkzopeinstance --dir=$HOME/myzope --user=admin:secret123

To start Zope3 server, go to your instance directory, then::

  $ cd ~/myzope
  $ ./bin/runzope

If you get a port error, check check 8080 and 8021 is already used by other 
programs; for the time being, just stop it.  Start your browser , the open
http://localhost:8080 .  What you see is the Zope Management Interface (ZMI).
ZMI is your Python prompt, hmm... no! Zope prompt, got it?.  You can login and
look around to see what's happening.  If you played enough with ZMI, stop it 
from terminal (Control + C).


BookMarker : Your first Zope3 app
---------------------------------

Yes! we are going to create a Zope3 application, an online book marker.
Our app will display links to websites and a description for each link.

So, what you have to think about when you start a Zope3 project.
Oh! sorry! I can't put it in one sentence, you better learn and 
practice Extreme Programming http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming.
Anyway, after your initial design, you will write interfaces.
Let us hope Python 3.0 will make it much easier.  Then you will write
unit tests, now your ideas become very concrete!.  At last write your
real code.  You will be satisfied when you implement interfaces one
by one and unit tests succeeds!. I have given the source code of
BookMarker here: `boom.tar.bz2`_

.. _boom.tar.bz2:
  ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/zissue/boom.tar.bz2

Our code will be placed at $HOME/myzope/lib/python/boom

First create a file *interfaces.py* where we will keep our interfaces.
Later we will implement these interfaces one by one, with strong support
of unit testing.


Interfaces
----------

Here is our interfaces.py::

  from zope.interface import Interface
  from zope.schema import Text, TextLine, Field

  from zope.app.container.constraints import ContainerTypesConstraint
  from zope.app.container.constraints import ItemTypePrecondition
  from zope.app.container.interfaces import IContained, IContainer

  class IMark(Interface):
      """This is the book mark object."""

      url = TextLine(
          title=u"URL/Link",
          description=u"URL of the website",
          default=u"http://www.zope.org",
          required=True)

      description = Text(
          title=u"Description",
          description=u"Description of the website",
          default=u"",
          required=False)

  class IBookMarker(IContainer):
      """This is the container for all book marks."""

      name = TextLine(
          title=u"Name of BookMarker",
          description=u"A name for BookMarker",
          default=u"",
          required=True)

      def __setitem__(name, obj):
          pass

      __setitem__.precondition = ItemTypePrecondition(IMark)
  

  class IMarkContained(IContained):
      """A book mark can only contain in a BookMarker"""

      __parent__ = Field(
          constraint = ContainerTypesConstraint(IBookMarker))
  

Our first interface `IMark` has two attributes, one is the URL of the site
and the other one is the description.  Please note, `IMark` is not a
*class* even though we used Python's class definition.  We inherited
from `Interface` to make it an interface.  Second one is a container
interface, which is an extended `IContainer` interface.  By using
this container interface we can persist our data (instances of
`IMark` implementations).  We will put all objects of `IMark`
in a container object of `IBookMarker`.  We will implement `IMark` along
with `IMarkContained` as a constraint interface. So that `IMark` object
will be only contained in an `IBookMarker` object.


Unit Testing
------------

Now create *tests.py* and put the following code there::

  import unittest
  from zope.testing.doctestunit import DocTestSuite

  from zope.app.container.tests.test_icontainer import TestSampleContainer

  from boom.bookmarker import BookMarker, Mark


  class BookMarkerContainerTest(TestSampleContainer):
    
      def makeBookMarkerObject(self):
          return BookMarker()

  def test_suite():
      return unittest.TestSuite((
          DocTestSuite('boom.bookmarker'),
          unittest.makeSuite(BookMarkerContainerTest),
          ))
            
  if __name__ == '__main__':
      unittest.main(defaultTest='test_suite') 

Actually, we are not written any unit tests here, but this will make
our doc tests working automatically.

To run the unit test::

  $ cd $HOME/myzope/lib
  $ ../bin/test -vpu --dir boom


Real coding!
------------

Now let's move on to the implementation (bookmarker.py)::

  __docformat__ = 'restructuredtext'

  from zope.interface import implements
  from zope.app.container.btree import BTreeContainer
  from zope.app.container.contained import Contained

  from boom.interfaces import IMark, IMarkContained, IBookMarker

  class Mark(Contained):
      """Implementation of IMark

      Make sure that the `Mark` implements the `IMark` interface::

        >>> from zope.interface.verify import verifyClass
        >>> verifyClass(IMark, Mark)
        True

      Make sure that the `Mark` implements the `IMarkContained` interface:

        >>> from zope.interface.verify import verifyClass
        >>> verifyClass(IMarkContained, Mark)
        True

      An example of checking the url of Mark::

        >>> mk = Mark()
        >>> mk.url
        u'http://www.zope.org'
        >>> mk.url = u'http://www.python.org'
        >>> mk.url
        u'http://www.python.org'
    
      An example of checking the description of Mark::

        >>> mk = Mark()
        >>> mk.description
        u''
        >>> mk.description = u'Zope Project Web Site'
        >>> mk.description
        u'Zope Project Web Site'
      """

      implements(IMark, IMarkContained)

      url = u"http://www.zope.org"
      description = u""


  class BookMarker(BTreeContainer):
      """Implementation of IBookMarker using B-Tree Container

      Make sure that the `BookMarker` implements the `IBookMarker` interface::

        >>> from zope.interface.verify import verifyClass
        >>> verifyClass(IBookMarker, BookMarker)
        True

      An example of changing the name of BookMarker::

        >>> bm = BookMarker()
        >>> bm.name
        u''
        >>> bm.name = u'MyBookMarker'
        >>> bm.name
        u'MyBookMarker'
      """

      implements(IBookMarker)

      name = u""

We have written doctests along with the implementations.  Doctests are 
accompanied with examples, so it is called example driven unit testing.


Configuration
-------------

Now configuration (save in configure.zcml)::

  <configure
      xmlns="http://namespaces.zope.org/zope"
      xmlns:browser="http://namespaces.zope.org/browser">

    <interface
        interface=".interfaces.IBookMarker"
        type="zope.app.content.interfaces.IContentType"
        />

    <content class=".bookmarker.BookMarker">
      <implements
          interface="zope.app.annotation.interfaces.IAttributeAnnotatable"
          />
      <implements
          interface="zope.app.container.interfaces.IContentContainer" 
          />
      <factory
          id="boom.bookmarker.BookMarker"
          description="Book Marker" 
          />
      <require
          permission="zope.ManageContent"
          interface=".interfaces.IBookMarker"
          />
      <require
          permission="zope.ManageContent"
          set_schema=".interfaces.IBookMarker"
          />
    </content>

    <interface
        interface=".interfaces.IMark"
        type="zope.app.content.interfaces.IContentType"
        />

    <content class=".bookmarker.Mark">
      <implements
          interface="zope.app.annotation.interfaces.IAttributeAnnotatable"
          />
      <factory
          id="boom.bookmarker.Mark"
          description="A book mark." 
          />
      <require
          permission="zope.ManageContent"
          interface=".interfaces.IMark"/>
      <require
          permission="zope.ManageContent"
          set_schema=".interfaces.IMark"
          />
    </content>

    <browser:addform
        label="Add Book Marker"
        name="AddBookMarker.html"
        schema="boom.interfaces.IBookMarker"
        content_factory="boom.bookmarker.BookMarker"
        fields="name"
        permission="zope.ManageContent"
        />

    <browser:addMenuItem
        class=".bookmarker.BookMarker"
        title="Book Marker"
        permission="zope.ManageContent"
        view="AddBookMarker.html"
        />

    <browser:editform
        schema="boom.interfaces.IBookMarker"
        for="boom.interfaces.IBookMarker"
        label="Change Book Marker"
        name="edit.html"
        permission="zope.ManageContent"
        menu="zmi_views" title="Edit" 
        />

  <browser:containerViews
      for="boom.interfaces.IBookMarker"
      index="zope.View"
      contents="zope.View"
      add="zope.ManageContent"
      />

  <browser:addform
      label="Add Mark"
      name="AddMark.html"
      schema="boom.interfaces.IMark"
      content_factory="boom.bookmarker.Mark"
      fields="url description"
      permission="zope.ManageContent"
      />

  <browser:addMenuItem
      class="boom.bookmarker.Mark"
      title="Mark"
      description="URL of Website"
      permission="zope.ManageContent"
      view="AddMark.html"
      />

  <browser:editform
      schema="boom.interfaces.IMark"
      for="boom.interfaces.IMark"
      label="Change Mark"
      fields="url description"
      name="edit.html"
      permission="zope.ManageContent"
      menu="zmi_views" title="Edit" 
      />

  <browser:page
      name="marks.html"
      for="boom.interfaces.IBookMarker"
      class=".browser.BookMarks"
      template="marks.pt"
      permission="zope.Public"
      menu="zmi_views"
      title="Marks"
      />

  </configure>

Is it self explanatory? "no...!" then ok! we will discuss Zope Configuration
Markup Language (ZCML) briefly later.  Actually, if you are familiar with
ZCML this configuartion will be more than self explanatory.  It will give
you an overall idea about the entire application.  Now you might think,
it is not Pythonic :(  Hey! think twice!.


Just run it
-----------

As the last step to work our application, put the following line 
in: $HOME/myzope/etc/package-icludes/boom-configure.zcml::

 <include package="boom"/>

Now you registered your package.

Run zope again, then open your browser, add a BookMarker and few book marks.

Now you want to arrange your your book marks in a better way, don't you?.
For the time being, just relax, then we will create a view for book marks.


Views
-----

Now create a file named browser.py with following code::

  from boom.interfaces import IMark

  class BookMarks:

      def __init__(self, context, request, base_url=''):
          self.context = context
          self.request = request
          self.base_url = base_url

      def listMarks(self):
          marks = []
          for name, child in self.context.items():
              if IMark.providedBy(child):
                  info = {}
                  info['url'] = child.url
                  info['description'] = child.description
                  marks.append(info)
          return marks

Then one template (marks.pt)::

  <html metal:use-macro="views/standard_macros/view">
    <body>
      <div metal:fill-slot="body">

        <div class="row">
          <div class="label">Book Marks:</div>
          <br/><br/>
            <li tal:repeat="item view/listMarks">

              <a href="" tal:attributes="href item/url">
                 <span tal:content="item/url">Link</span>
              </a>
              <pre tal:content="item/description">Description</pre>
              <br/>

            </li>
        </div>

      </div>
    </body>
  </html>
 
Now by clicking on "Marks" tab you can see all book marks.

Ok! this is not the end, just the beginning of your study.


Functional testing
------------------

Let's finish our example writing a functional test for view (ftests.py)::

  import unittest
  from zope.app.testing.functional import BrowserTestCase

  class BookMarksTest(BrowserTestCase):

      def testMarksListing(self):
          pass


  def test_suite():
      return unittest.TestSuite((
          unittest.makeSuite(BookMarksTest),
          ))

  if __name__ == '__main__':
      unittest.main(defaultTest='test_suite')

To run the functional test::

  $ cd $HOME/myzope/lib
  $ ../bin/test -vpf --dir boom

Now what?
---------

Now you can start learning Zope3 in detail, using Zope3 book.
Also join zope3-users mailing list.

There is a good Zope3 quick start guide by Benji York:
http://www.benjiyork.com/quick_start/

A good introductory book is also available in print, visit:
http://worldcookery.com/

Just one more thing: I want to improve this document, so don't 
hesitate to write your feedback to: baiju.m.mail AT gmail.com


Hey! What's time now?
---------------------

Oh! it's only 10 minutes since we started reading this article.
We got 20 more minutes to explain what's happened here.
So let's look back again.


Installation and Configuration
------------------------------

You can download Zope 3.1.0 or later for your major works.
Install Zope3 as root, though it is not necessary.  When you
experiment  with Zope3, make instance as a normal user. For production
systems, you get the additional advantage of OS level security.
Since we manually installed Zope3 (as root), the default installation
path will be /usr/local/Zope-3.1.x .  When making zope instance,
you have to specify zope manager's user name and password.
You can make more instances, if required.

In your Zope 3 instance directory, there are few directories with
specific purposes. Here ownwards I will be using $ZOPE3INSTANCE to
refer your instance directory

$ZOPE3INSTANCE/etc
  In 'etc' you can see some configuration files.
  In $ZOPE3INSTANCE/etc/zope.conf you can edit port numbers
  of http and ftp servers.

$ZOPE3INSTANCE/var
  Zope saving all data here. Backup this directory regulary.
  If 'Data.fs' is missing, it will be automatically created when you
  run zope again.

$ZOPE3INSTANCE/bin
  Few utility scripts. 'runzope' and 'test' are already familiar to you.
  'pyskel' script will be very useful for creating template codes from
  interfaces, Example::

    $ $ZOPE3INSTANCE/bin/pyskel  boom.interfaces.IMark > file.py
    
$ZOPE3INSTANCE/lib/python
  As I said earlier you can place your Zope3 packages here.
  By default this won't be in your Python path.
  You can also place your package in any standard Python path.


Why should I code like this?
----------------------------

When we started discussing BookMarker, the first word I coined is
Extreme Programming (XP).  I strongly recommend you to read about
Extreme Programming, it will really influence you to write code in
Zope3 way (directly and indirectly).  Ok, one causion: many XPers
believe that frameworks are bad.  Here, I can not give an answer
in one sentence, so you find out yourself.  "Extreme Programming
Explained" by Kent Beck will be a good starting point for your study.
By the way, another classic book which you can read is "Design
Patterns" by Gang of Four.  In this book they say : 'Program to an
interface, not to an implementation'.  To simulate a formal definition
of interfaces in C++, they used classes with virtual functions.
Just like this, in Python we will use zope.interface.Interfce
inherited metaclass for defining an interface.  There is every chance
for an 'interface' concept in Python language by version 3.0 .
According to Extreme Programming: 'The four basic activities of
development are coding, testing, listening, and designing.'
Zope3 makes your software testing, a breeze.  You can write unit and
functional tests very easily.


Let's look into interfaces
--------------------------

I hope you are familiar with the concept of interfaces.
Anyway when we speak about an interface, we meant it to
use with reference to an object (i.e, an instance of a class).
For example if 'A' is a class which implements 'IA', and 'a'
is an instance of 'A', then 'IA' is the interface of 'a', got it?
But normally we only deals with the interface and its implementing
class.

In our *interfaces.py* we defined three interfaces.
The first interface 'IMark' defines a book mark object.
A book mark has two attributes, one is the url
and another one is the description.  We used schemas available at
zope.schema package to specify these attributes.

As we mentioned earlier `IBookMarker` is a container interface.
We extended `IContainer` interface with one `name` attribute.
Also we put one item type pre-condition.  So `IBookMarker` object can only
contain an `IMark` object.  Now before moving to next section, please note
from which packages and modules we imported different classes/interfaces.
Just open the sources of those packages, and see how well documented
they are!.  Some documentation are written in seperate ReStructuredText
files with unit testing, this is the Zope3 way of unit testing.


Unit testing re-visited
-----------------------


Let's talk about implementations
--------------------------------


ZCML, the oasis in Zope3
------------------------

If you think Zope3 is a desert, then ZCML is the oasis there.


Views and ZPT

Why and how functional testing?
-------------------------------


The things we didn't mentioned
------------------------------


The End
-------

Oh! it is just the end of this article.  And the great beginning of
your journey through Zope3 world.  So, good luck.
