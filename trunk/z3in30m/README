================================================

Copyright 2005 Baiju M <baiju.m.mail@gmail.com> 


My considerations while writing this article
--------------------------------------------

 1. Zope3 introducing tutorial to motivate Python
    programmers.

 2. The document should not be too formal, also not too informal.

 3. Grammar mistakes and wrong usage of words/phrases should
    be avoided.

 4. Don't cover all aspects of every problem.

 5. A sentence shouldn't exceed 160 characters, unless an URL
    comes in between.

 6. Every paragraph should contain something motivative.

 7. After every full stop, there must be two spaces,
    unless it comes at the end the line.

 8. All sections should end with two blank lines.

 9. Within two days after reading this article, the reader can
    access google.com

 10. Zope3 book is available for reference.
